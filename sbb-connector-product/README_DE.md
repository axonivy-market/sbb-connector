Axon Ivy's SBB Connector integrates the [Swiss Mobility API](https://developer.sbb.ch/apis/b2p/information) provided by SBB. This connector uses a REST client that allows you to retrieve timetables and fare details. Additionally, you can create and manage bookings of Swiss public transport through the API.

Note that credentials are required to gain access to any features of the API. Although they are provided free of charge by SBB, the purpose of their API is to generate sales turnover through it. For more information about access, features and capabilities, visit the info page of the [Swiss Mobility API](https://developer.sbb.ch/apis/b2p/information).
